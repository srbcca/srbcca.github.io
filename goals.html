			<h1>Goals</h1>
			<p>Hello! This project is an experiment to address some ideas I've had to:</p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li><i>undertake a 100-day initiative:</i> After tossing around the idea extensively with my friend <a href="http://www.elletse.com"/>Shelley</a> and taking off roughly a year from any kind of regular blogging or writing, I'm out of practice. I recognize the fear of putting things out that increases when it's been a while since you've put your work into the wild and things you write are too precious and you're afraid to fail. I'd like to get back into a comfortable habit of writing.</li><br>
				<li> <i>form somewhat of a morning routine.</i> I'm almost only externally motivated when it comes to morning routines, which is great for work trips, CM events, hungry puppies wanting bfast, or early morning meetings, but when it comes to intrinsic structure, any ambitions roughly disappear. The mornings are a wonderful quiet time, and I'd like to look forward to them!</li><br>
				<li><i>consistently read</i>. I can't remember the last time I got excited about a writing project, or setting aside time to read and write. I'm looking forward to making this a habit. </p>
