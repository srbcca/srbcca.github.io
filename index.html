				<h1>The glory that comes from __</h1>
				<div class="quote">"Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God" (12:43).</div>
				<p>Belief in Jesus was growing after he raised Lazarus. Mary poured expensive perfume on his feet and wiped them with her hair. He's greeted with a crowd and palm branches in Jerusalem as he sits on a donkey, God speaks to him among a crowd inquiring about the Son of Man being lifted up... Jesus knows his time has come. Yet, still some did not believe. Some believed and did not confess it.</p>
				<p>I've found myself asking, "Who do I live for?" And at times, I've really got to think about what my actions show me what I believe. Do I worship and serve myself first and overall without any regret or thought?</p>
				<p>Recently, I've been thinking about what I use my resources for and I might want to invest them in. What happened to any dreams of living off less, giving much away, only owning and using what I need, and a lifestyle that might seem more different than I thought of where I am? I'd like for my heart to drive the way I live my life, and I desire that nothing would be lost in translation.</p>

				<h1>The Good Shepherd</h1>
				<div class="quote">"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand" (John 10:28).</div>
				<p>A few years ago, my friend H. and I were asked to read the Bible with a gal that was interested. At first, I believe we were hesitant. I didn't know if I felt ready, and we didn't know the gal, and other excuses that I really can't remember.</p>
				<p>Our friend that connected us said "Snap out of it!" Or something more or less along those lines. He said we have found someone who wants to read the Bible. Will you do it? And we said yes.</p>
				<p>Following was a couple of months where we would meet up and read stories: many parables, new testament, and the times were always pretty great. I remember feeling hesitant in myself and a lot of times, Helen would lead and ask the questions in a DBS-style study.</p>
				<p>After a few months, we stopped and I may have thought that the gal had lost interest. But I heard later that she had actually started going to a different church, and had gotten baptized, and although I was only learning at the time, I couldn't help but appreciate to be even a part of that.</p>
				<h2>* * *</h2>
				<p>A few times, I feel like I've heard H. quote this very verse: Jesus' sheep recognize his voice when they hear it, so there is nothing to fear. And when they hear it, they will follow, because they're of his flock, and they know he is the good shepherd. He knows them by name, all of them, and lays down his life for the sheep, unlike a hired hand.</p>
				<p>I really like this passage. I love that the shepherd calls all of his sheep by name, and they go in and out of him, the door, and find pasture. He's not just a shepherd, he's a good shepherd. He knows his sheep, and they know him. He comes so that they can have abundant life, and that is something that can never be lost.</p>

				<h1>John 9</h1>
				<h2>Holistic verse:</h2>

					<div class="quote">"Jesus answered, 'It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.'"</div>
					<h2>Some Pharisees, trying to reason:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?"</div>
					<h2>The parents of the healed man, perhaps in fear:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself."</div>
					<h2>The man, with confidence and challenge:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples? </div>
					<h2>The man, then sure of his words: </h2>
					<div class="quote">"Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</div>
					<h2>The Pharisees: aware of their compared knowledge and status:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?"</div>
					<h2>The man to Jesus, wanting to know who he's talking to:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"</div>
					<h2>Jesus, revealing his cards after finding the man:</h2>
					<div class="quote">"You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you."</div>
					<h2>Jesus, on principles: </h2>
					<div class="quote">"For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind."</div>
					<p>Words that come to mind: humbleness, to being open to being wrong and having someone else set you right. Those who doubted Jesus and as well as those who were curious/hesitant both needed Jesus to clarify exactly who he was.  </p>
					<p>Another word: truth. It is not enough for Jesus to be recognized as a "prophet" or miracle worker, but as the Son of God, recognized, believed, and worshiped. It is not enough for the man to be healed of his vision. It's important, but the story doesn't stop there. Jesus seeks him out to reveal himself as filling the right recipient of worship in his life, to sin no more, in line with helping those blind to actually see. </p>

				<h1>John 8</h1>
				<div class="quote">Neither do I condemn you; go and from now on sin no more" (11).</div>

					<p>This is what Jesus says this to the woman caught in adultery, brought to Jesus in question of being stoned.</p>

					<p>Jesus said to the Jews that any without sin should be first to throw a stone. One by one, they all walked away, and she was left with Jesus. When he asks if anyone has condemned her, she says none.</p>

					<p>She is guilty, but he tells her that she is not condemned. She is guilty, but Jesus tells her to turn away from her sin.</p>

					<p>* * *</p>

					<p>In the rest of the chapter, Jesus says things like, </p>

					<div class="quote">I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life" (12),</div>

					<p>and things like,</p>

					<div class="quote">"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (31-32),</div>

					<p>both of which are bold claims. You will not walk in darkness, you will have the light of life, you will know the truth, and you will be set free: free indeed. Follow, abide, walk, know. </p>

					<p>He also talks to this group of people that don't understand him because they were not of God (47), thus they could not bear to hear his word (43). They were shocked to hear that Jesus claimed he was greater than Abraham (or that he even saw him), and did not seem aware of their sin or that they could be enslaved to it (34). They wondered who Jesus was, if he was afflicted, and picked up stones to throw at him. </p>

					<p>* * *</p>

					<p>So who is Jesus here? He says he's not of this world and is from above. Some believed, and some rejected him. But he calls us out of our sin and speaks with the authority of God, sent by God. He says that you are free if the Son sets you free. What kind of person would do that, and why?</p>

				<h1>John 7</h1>
				<h2>Thought-provoking:</h2>
				<div class="quote"><p>"Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water'" (38).</p></div>
				<p><h2>Easily undermined:</h2><p>

				<p>The power of the Spirit (above). Old Testament prophets encountered God and New Testament disciples talked to Jesus directly, but we are special in that we get the Spirit as a deposit.<p>
				<p><h2>Easily forgotten:</h2><p>
				<p>That the Spirit has the power to change hearts (mine included). That he dwells within us.<p>
				<p><h2>Preceding verse of action:</h2><p>
				<div class="quote"><p>"On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink."</p></div>
				<p><h2>Referenced verse of emotion:</h2><p>
				<div class="quote"><p>"With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation" (Isa 12:3)</p></div>
				<p>I'm praying for the joy of my salvation.</p>
				<p><h2>Fruits of the Spirit to pray for in this season:</h2><p>

				<h1>John 6</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal" (27).</p></div>
				<p>After Jesus feeds the 5,000, he retreats to the mountain after perceiving that the crowd would want to force him to be king.</p>

				<p>That evening, he walks on water toward his frightened disciples in a boat. He reminds them who he is, and to not be afraid. They gladly take him in and surprisingly arrive across the sea. </p>

				<p>The next day, he calls the crowd out for pursuing him because of the loaves of bread, not because of who he is. And since everyone's there because of the bread, he tells them there's a bread that comes from heaven. And no, it's better than the manna from history in the wilderness, it's beyond the physical.</p>


				<p>More than that, the bread is a person - it's Jesus himself. The true bread from heaven, the bread of life that will be broken and raised up. And to have life, you must partake of it, which can be easily misconstrued. So much so that the Jews disputed and questioned who he was and some disciples walked away.</p>

				<p>Better than giving the miraculous loaves or demonstrating mastery over water, Jesus provides a bold claim: himself, his presence, his words as the bread of life. He attests that there is more than the physical because even then, the Father "draws" those who come to Jesus (44) and the Spirit "gives life" whereas the flesh is no help at all (63).</p>

				<p>As I drive on Mopac and rearrange my room and cook with friends, I contemplate: do I believe that Jesus is who he says he is--not merely the son of a couple named Joseph and Mary, but the bread of life, whose body and blood was sacrificed so we could live forever? I ask myself: am I living for more than the physical? To trust and take of Jesus is to bank my whole life on him, because he's much better than any other kind of bread.</p>


				<p>I recognize the skepticism that fuels the question of if anything good could come from Nazareth (John 1:46), yet marvel at the beauty of that kind of lowly humbleness, and I see Peter's faith when he says "Lord, to whom shall we go?" Of course, it would be the Savior of the world, born in a barn.</p>


				<p>Peter says that he has "come to know" that Jesus is the "Holy One of God" (68). The whole process of coming to know, in relationships and friendships and spiritually, seems like it consists of quite a bit, and it seems to be always surprising. </p>

				<h1>John 5</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life" (40).</p></div>
				<p>When I was on a trip overseas years ago, some friends and I met a man that, upon receiving a tract, asked my friend for clarification on how to get to heaven. He then told us he was having dreams of Jesus and that he grew up Muslim, but when he read the Qu'ran, all he could see was that it prophesied about and pointed to Jesus as the way. He believed Jesus was God and in the virgin birth.</p>

				<p>This was amazing to me and what followed was a crazy, awesome thing that I got to tangibly experience that is more personable told in person.</p>

				<p>For a text to bear witness about the truth of Jesus to a person is a God-breathed mystery in which the Spirit is at work and Jesus speaks for himself. For a person to bear witness about Jesus in spoken word and testimony is such a gift and a wonder.</p>

				<p>In John 5, Jesus asked a paralyzed man if he wanted to be healed. The man gave a few reasons why the pool wasn't going to work out, and with words, Jesus told him to get up, pick up his mat, and walk/go home. And after 38 years of paralysis, he did. But regarding his interesting original question of asking if he wanted to be healed: he told him to sin no more and from another account, that his said his sins were forgiven. It wasn't just a physical healing. And all witnesses of the miracle feared and glorified God.</p>

				<p>I can attest that sometimes we get so caught up in doing things right that we forget about the actual people we are interacting with. We forget we're witnesses of some of the greatest miracles in our lives, and we forget so easily once they've happened. We can wait for so long for prayers to answered that we think we lose hope, and all it takes a word from Jesus for us to feel alive again.</p>


				<p>May we not get so caught up in reading disciplines or major life milestones or schedules or __ while missing the point: encountering the person of Jesus. </p>

				<h1>John 4</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"Jesus said to him, 'Go; your son will live.' The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way" (4:50).</p></div>

				<p>I suspect I've forgotten the excitement of the unfolding of promises. When you're granted a "yes" or a promise, but have yet to see it come to fruition--you know what will happen. But how will it happen? Seems like the question of the season.</p>

				<p>This man heard about Jesus and asked him to come and heal his dying son. He believed when Jesus said his son would live.</p>

				<p>And as he headed back, he encountered his servants, who told him his son was recovering, and it began when Jesus said it would be so, and he connected the dots. And again, he believed in him (curious how this believing may be different from before). And then, his family believed. </p>

				<p>Sometimes I want a sign, a coincidence, something spectacular, a green light, affirmation or complete divine confirmation first. And a few moments, I think I've gotten it.</p>
				<p>But the other times, the unfolding is painful, and it requires hoping in God, and remembering end promises, and a tempering during the process. As we heard last Thursday evening, it is indeed, a season of waiting - in discipline, future, and prayers along the way.</p>

				<h1>John 3</h1>
				<div class="quote"><p>"John answered, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.' (27)"</p></div>
				<p>Something that I've greatly forgotten: everything I have I've received. Maybe I've asked for it, maybe I didn't even think to ask for it. Maybe I couldn't even have imagined to ask for it, or was too proud to ask for it, or was too faithless to keep asking for it, or didn't even know that asking was an option. But what I've received, someone decided it was good or right to give.</p>

				<p>That means that my career, the favor I have in my relationships, or the settling and clarity of decisions I've made came didn't come purely from great decisions that I've made, or strong feelings that I've acted on, or any great skill or compassion or social practice, or whatever else I can try to take credit for. But God gave me everything in his right timing and great giving, and I believe he will continue to do that.</p>

				<p>One thing I'd like to do: receive well. Recognize what I'm receiving, recognize that I can ask and should ask, and recognize that God gives. I'd like to be not too boastful or faithless to ask, and I'd like to ask knowing that it would be joyful to be said "yes" to and freely receive. </p>
