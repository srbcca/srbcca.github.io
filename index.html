			<h1>John 4</h1>
			<div class="quote"><p>"Jesus said to him, 'Go; your son will live.' The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way" (4:50).</p></div>

			<p>I suspect I've forgotten the excitement of the unfolding of promises. When you're granted a "yes" or a promise, but have yet to see it come to fruition--you know what will happen. But how will it happen? Seems like the question of the season.</p>

			<p>This man heard about Jesus and asked him to come and heal his dying son. He believed when Jesus said his son would live.</p>

			<p>And as he headed back, he encountered his servants, who told him his son was recovering, and it began when Jesus said it would be so, and he connected the dots. And again, he believed in him (curious how this believing may be different from before). And then, his family believed. </p>

			<p>Sometimes I want a sign, a coincidence, something spectacular, a green light, affirmation or complete divine confirmation first. And a few moments, I think I've gotten it.</p>
			<p>But the other times, the unfolding is painful, and it requires hoping in God, and remembering end promises, and a tempering during the process. As we heard last Thursday evening, it is indeed, a season of waiting - in discipline, future, and prayers along the way.</p>
			<!--End of Day 2-->
			
			<!--Start of Day 1-->
			<div class ="day">1</div>
			<h1>John 3</h1>
			<div class="quote"><p>"John answered, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.' (27)"</p></div>
			<p>Something that I've greatly forgotten: everything I have I've received. Maybe I've asked for it, maybe I didn't even think to ask for it. Maybe I couldn't even have imagined to ask for it, or was too proud to ask for it, or was too faithless to keep asking for it, or didn't even know that asking was an option. But what I've received, someone decided it was good or right to give.</p>

			<p>That means that my career, the favor I have in my relationships, or the settling and clarity of decisions I've made came didn't come purely from great decisions that I've made, or strong feelings that I've acted on, or any great skill or compassion or social practice, or whatever else I can try to take credit for. But God gave me everything in his right timing and great giving, and I believe he will continue to do that.</p>

			<p>One thing I'd like to do: receive well. Recognize what I'm receiving, recognize that I can ask and should ask, and recognize that God gives. I'd like to be not too boastful or faithless to ask, and I'd like to ask knowing that it would be joyful to be said "yes" to and freely receive. </p>
