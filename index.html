			<h1>John 3</h1>
			<p class="quote">"John answered, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.'"</p>
			<p>Something that I've greatly forgotten: everything I have I've received. Maybe I've asked for it, maybe I didn't even think to ask for it. Maybe I couldn't even have imagined to ask for it, or was too proud to ask for it, or was too faithless to keep asking for it, or didn't even know that asking was an option. But what I've received, someone decided it was good or right to give.</p>

			<p>That means that my career, the favor I have in my relationships, or the settling and clarity of decisions I've made came didn't come purely from great decisions that I've made, or strong feelings that I've acted on, or any great skill or compassion or social practice, or whatever else I can try to take credit for. But God gave me everything in his right timing and great giving, and I believe he will continue to do that.</p>

			<p>One thing I'd like to do: receive well. Recognize what I'm receiving, recognize that I can ask and should ask, and recognize that God gives. I'd like to be not too boastful or faithless to ask, and I'd like to ask knowing that it would be joyful to be said "yes" to and freely receive. </p>
