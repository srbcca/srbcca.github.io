				<h1>John 6</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal" (27).</p></div>
				<p>After Jesus feeds the 5,000, he retreats to the mountain after perceiving that the crowd would want to force him to be king.</p>

				<p>That evening, he walks on water toward his frightened disciples in a boat. He reminds them who he is, and to not be afraid. They gladly take him in and surprisingly arrive across the sea. </p>

				<p>The next day, he calls the crowd out for pursuing him because of the loaves of bread, not because of who he is. And since everyone's there because of the bread, he tells them there's a bread that comes from heaven. And no, it's better than the manna from history in the wilderness, it's beyond the physical.</p>


				<p>More than that, the bread is a person - it's Jesus himself. The true bread from heaven, the bread of life that will be broken and raised up. And to have life, you must partake of it, which can be easily misconstrued. So much so that the Jews disputed and questioned who he was and some disciples walked away.</p>

				<p>Better than giving the miraculous loaves or demonstrating mastery over water, Jesus provides a bold claim: himself, his presence, his words as the bread of life. He attests that there is more than the physical because even then, the Father "draws" those who come to Jesus (44) and the Spirit "gives life" whereas the flesh is no help at all (63).</p>

				<p>As I drive on Mopac and rearrange my room and cook with friends, I contemplate: do I believe that Jesus is who he says he is--not merely the son of a couple named Joseph and Mary, but the bread of life, whose body and blood was sacrificed so we could live forever? I ask myself: am I living for more than the physical? To trust and take of Jesus is to bank my whole life on him, because he's much better than any other kind of bread.</p>


				<p>I recognize the skepticism that fuels the question of if anything good could come from Nazareth (John 1:46), yet marvel at the beauty of that kind of lowly humbleness, and I see Peter's faith when he says "Lord, to whom shall we go?" Of course, it would be the Savior of the world, born in a barn.</p>


				<p>Peter says that he has "come to know" that Jesus is the "Holy One of God" (68). The whole process of coming to know, in relationships and friendships and spiritually, seems like it consists of quite a bit, and it seems to be always surprising. </p>

				<h1>John 5</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life" (40).</p></div>
				<p>When I was on a trip overseas years ago, some friends and I met a man that, upon receiving a tract, asked my friend for clarification on how to get to heaven. He then told us he was having dreams of Jesus and that he grew up Muslim, but when he read the Qu'ran, all he could see was that it prophesied about and pointed to Jesus as the way. He believed Jesus was God and in the virgin birth.</p>

				<p>This was amazing to me and what followed was a crazy, awesome thing that I got to tangibly experience that is more personable told in person.</p>

				<p>For a text to bear witness about the truth of Jesus to a person is a God-breathed mystery in which the Spirit is at work and Jesus speaks for himself. For a person to bear witness about Jesus in spoken word and testimony is such a gift and a wonder.</p>

				<p>In John 5, Jesus asked a paralyzed man if he wanted to be healed. The man gave a few reasons why the pool wasn't going to work out, and with words, Jesus told him to get up, pick up his mat, and walk/go home. And after 38 years of paralysis, he did. But regarding his interesting original question of asking if he wanted to be healed: he told him to sin no more and from another account, that his said his sins were forgiven. It wasn't just a physical healing. And all witnesses of the miracle feared and glorified God.</p>

				<p>I can attest that sometimes we get so caught up in doing things right that we forget about the actual people we are interacting with. We forget we're witnesses of some of the greatest miracles in our lives, and we forget so easily once they've happened. We can wait for so long for prayers to answered that we think we lose hope, and all it takes a word from Jesus for us to feel alive again.</p>


				<p>May we not get so caught up in reading disciplines or major life milestones or schedules or __ while missing the point: encountering the person of Jesus. </p>

				<h1>John 4</h1>
			
				<div class="quote"><p>"Jesus said to him, 'Go; your son will live.' The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way" (4:50).</p></div>

				<p>I suspect I've forgotten the excitement of the unfolding of promises. When you're granted a "yes" or a promise, but have yet to see it come to fruition--you know what will happen. But how will it happen? Seems like the question of the season.</p>

				<p>This man heard about Jesus and asked him to come and heal his dying son. He believed when Jesus said his son would live.</p>

				<p>And as he headed back, he encountered his servants, who told him his son was recovering, and it began when Jesus said it would be so, and he connected the dots. And again, he believed in him (curious how this believing may be different from before). And then, his family believed. </p>

				<p>Sometimes I want a sign, a coincidence, something spectacular, a green light, affirmation or complete divine confirmation first. And a few moments, I think I've gotten it.</p>
				<p>But the other times, the unfolding is painful, and it requires hoping in God, and remembering end promises, and a tempering during the process. As we heard last Thursday evening, it is indeed, a season of waiting - in discipline, future, and prayers along the way.</p>

				<h1>John 3</h1>
				<div class="quote"><p>"John answered, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.' (27)"</p></div>
				<p>Something that I've greatly forgotten: everything I have I've received. Maybe I've asked for it, maybe I didn't even think to ask for it. Maybe I couldn't even have imagined to ask for it, or was too proud to ask for it, or was too faithless to keep asking for it, or didn't even know that asking was an option. But what I've received, someone decided it was good or right to give.</p>

				<p>That means that my career, the favor I have in my relationships, or the settling and clarity of decisions I've made came didn't come purely from great decisions that I've made, or strong feelings that I've acted on, or any great skill or compassion or social practice, or whatever else I can try to take credit for. But God gave me everything in his right timing and great giving, and I believe he will continue to do that.</p>

				<p>One thing I'd like to do: receive well. Recognize what I'm receiving, recognize that I can ask and should ask, and recognize that God gives. I'd like to be not too boastful or faithless to ask, and I'd like to ask knowing that it would be joyful to be said "yes" to and freely receive. </p>
